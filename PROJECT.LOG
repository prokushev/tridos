Open issues:

* File sharing bug - fails under massive tests. FIXED
[Bug at add_open when opening file].

* HeapFreePage problems - gets incomprehencible input. FIXED

* DPMI.


18/04/99
--------

Open issues:

* Improper task switching (long blocks) with INT 28 handling.
[Batch processor calls INT 28h on each iteration. Task can get blocked when
owning a semaphore or when file is open. INT 28h "block" must be replaced
with something less strict. Probably INT 16h can be blocked firmly].

* Optimize all system traps.

* DPMI.

* Configuration file.

* Virtualize other standard devices (timer, PIC, etc)


19/04/99
--------

Open issues:

* Improper task switching (long blocks) with INT 28 handling. SOLVED.
{INT 28h doesn't block current task, but instead simply releases current time
share}

* Optimize all system traps.
Consider:
- Try to avoid double saving registers (save directly to task's structure). INEFFICIENT
- Keep pointer to current, foreground etc. tasks handy. DONE
- Set common interrupts (13h, 20h-2Fh, 10h, 16h, 31h) directly callable.

* DPMI.

* Configuration file.

* Virtualize other standard devices (timer, PIC, etc)


Known bugs/anomalies:

* If memory map is allocated beneath OsStartPage, #PF.

-----------

Work on the project resumed!

Fixed check for open file names and rebooting DPMI exception handler reporting.
